# RockPaperScissors
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors prediction project! This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to predict the outcomes of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training neural networks.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the outcome of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game based on historical data. This involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of past Rock-Paper-Scissors games.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features that can help the model understand patterns in the data.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
6. **Optimization**: Fine-tuning the models to improve their accuracy.

## Future Development

To take this project to the next level, here are a few ideas for future development:

1. **Expanding the Dataset**: Collect more data to improve the model's generalization capabilities.
2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Explore more complex features and techniques to enhance model performance.
3. **Deep Learning Models**: Implement more sophisticated neural network architectures for potentially better accuracy.
4. **Real-time Prediction**: Develop a real-time prediction system using a web interface or a mobile app.
5. **Explainability**: Implement methods to explain the model's predictions and understand the underlying decision-making process.
6. **Integration with Game**: Integrate the model with an actual Rock-Paper-Scissors game to provide real-time predictions and feedback.
